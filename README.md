## A Call analytics application for the engineering support team at Vas Tech, where I am currently a network intern

In the meeting for july, our CEO asked the support team to provide him with a detailed analytics of support render by the engineering support team.
I discovered they manually didn't have an automated way for getting this support. So I create VATSCA, a call support analytics tool for easily getting the analytics the CEO required.
The tool, uses fyne ui toolkit, and it times calls, records call details and creates and excel sheets where the analytics can be generated from.
