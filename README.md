# VATSCA  aka Call Panda
## A Call analytics application for the engineering support team at Vas Tech, where I am currently a network intern

In the meeting for july, our CEO asked the support team to provide him with a detailed analytics of the support rendered by the engineering support team to network customers and 
I discovered they didn't have an automated way for getting this data for analysing the support. So I create VATSCA (aka Call Panda), a call support analytics tool for easily getting the analytics the CEO required.

This tool, uses fyne ui toolkit, records call details and creates and excel sheets where the analytics can be generated from.

I will be creating a windows setup file since the support team uses windows pc.
